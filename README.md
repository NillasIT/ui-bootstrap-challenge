# UI Bootstrap Challenge

## Personal UI Challenge with Bootstrap

This repository contains my personal project for the **UI Bootstrap Challenge**, where I used **Bootstrap** to create responsive and modern interfaces. The goal is to enhance my skills in design and front-end development, as well as learn more about integrating Bootstrap components with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The challenge involves creating a login page and other pages with a clean, user-friendly design, using Bootstrap resources to ensure the interfaces are responsive and work well across various devices.

## Challenge Goals

1. **Learn how to use Bootstrap effectively**:
   - Use Bootstrap's grid system to create responsive layouts.
   - Apply Bootstrapâ€™s pre-built components (such as buttons, forms, alerts, etc.).
   
2. **Develop a simple and efficient UI**:
   - Create clean, minimalist interfaces focused on a good user experience.
   - Improve the design with a harmonious color palette and well-distributed elements.

3. **Enhance skills in responsive design**:
   - Build pages that adjust seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
   - Implement media queries and leverage Bootstrap's responsive classes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Content structure.
- **CSS**: Custom styling, in addition to using Bootstrap classes.
- **Bootstrap 4/5**: A CSS framework to facilitate the creation of responsive, beautiful layouts.
- **JavaScript**: For basic interactivity, if needed.
